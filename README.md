# Alarm Clock

This project was made to practice using Python's interactive libraries, tkinter, datetime and winsound, for making an alarm clock. 
This program provides a user-interface for users to set up an alarm clock (using the 24-hour format). This project helped me strengthen my GUI skills and was
a fun project that I use to set alarms when wstudying and working. 

Libraries Used: tkinter,winsound,datetime,and time.
